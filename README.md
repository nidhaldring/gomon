# GoMon:
A change watcher similar to nodemon but made with go <3.

# Note:
1. This was made for my personal use but any PRs for improvements are welcome
2. This only works for go modules

# Usage:
1. Build the project
```
go build .
```

2. Use the binary (copy it everywhere you want)
```
./gomon
```
